# Repo Explainer

### Great technology deserves a great first impression.

*You built something powerful. Now let people actually understand it.*

## The problem: brilliant tools, invisible impact

You poured months into something genuinely useful. You shipped it to GitHub. And then... silence. A developer lands on your repo, scans the README, hits a wall of jargon, and quietly closes the tab. Not because your tool isn't good — but because the *introduction* isn't.

The truth is, most GitHub repos are written by people who already understand the project, for people who already understand the project. That leaves out the vast majority of potential users — the people who *would* love your tool if they could just see what it does and imagine themselves using it.

## The solution: a visual explainer that opens the door

**Repo Explainer turns any GitHub repository into a polished, visual explainer page** — the kind of introduction that makes a newcomer think *"oh, I get it — and I want to try this."*

Instead of a wall of text, your project gets:

- A **captivating hero image** and a one-sentence pitch that hooks curiosity
- A **plain-language walkthrough** that answers the questions people actually ask: *What is this? Why would I want it? How do I start?*
- **Architecture diagrams and illustrations** that make complex systems feel approachable
- A **relatable before-and-after story** — a real persona who goes from confused to confident
- **Concrete use-cases** so people can see themselves in the story

The result is a standalone website that lives at its own URL, looks professional, and gives your project the introduction it deserves.

> **Think of it this way:** your README is the technical reference. Your explainer is the welcome mat.

---

## Why this matters

Technology adoption isn't just about capability — it's about **confidence**. When someone encounters a new tool, they're asking themselves a series of quiet questions:

- *Is this for me?*
- *Can I actually use this?*
- *What does it look like when it works?*
- *Will I be lost if I try?*

A great explainer answers all of these in under three minutes. It bridges the gap between "this looks interesting" and "I'm going to try this today." That's the difference between a repo with 12 stars and a project with a growing community.

**Visual presentation isn't vanity — it's accessibility.** When your project looks polished and approachable, you're telling people: *"We thought about you. We want you here. You can do this."*

---

## How it works

Paste a GitHub URL. That's it.

The pipeline reads your entire repository — code, docs, structure — and produces a complete explainer page automatically. No templates to fill out, no design skills needed, no content to write.

> **Paste a URL → the pipeline clones your repo, builds a knowledge base, authors a visual explainer, generates images, runs quality checks, and deploys it — all in about 6 minutes.**

![The automated build pipeline: user pastes a URL, Vercel validates and dispatches to GitHub Actions, which runs 9 phases and updates a status gist that the client polls in real time.](assets/diagrams/pipeline.svg)

<details>
<summary>What happens behind the scenes (9 phases)</summary>

| Phase | What it does | Time |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **Phase 0** Setup | Prepare the build environment | ~30s |
| **Phase 1** Clone | Download your repo's code and docs | ~10s |
| **Phase 2** Knowledge base | Analyze your code and embed it into a searchable vector database | ~60s |
| **Phase 3** Scaffold | Create the explainer site structure | ~10s |
| **Phase 4** Author | Write 9 sections of plain-language content | ~90s |
| **Phase 5** Images | Generate hero image and section illustrations | ~60s |
| **Phase 6** Quality gates | Check accuracy, completeness, and visual quality | ~60s |
| **Phase 7** Publish | Create a GitHub repo and invite you as a collaborator | ~20s |
| **Phase 8** Deploy | Launch your live site at `{repo}.repoexplainer.isovision.ai` | ~30s |
| **Phase 9** Notify | Send you an email when it's ready | ~5s |

</details>

You watch the progress in real time. Every step updates live. If anything goes wrong, you'll know immediately — the pipeline never fails silently.

### What you get back

When the pipeline finishes, you have:

1. **A live website** at `yourproject.repoexplainer.isovision.ai` — ready to share
2. **A GitHub repo** (`stuinfla/yourproject-explainer`) — you're invited as a collaborator with push access, so you own it
3. **An email notification** with links to everything
4. **A PR on your original repo's README** — adds a badge linking to the explainer, which you can merge or skip

Everything is yours. No vendor lock-in, no subscriptions, no dependencies on this pipeline. The explainer is a self-contained site you can modify, fork, or host anywhere.

## What the visual layer adds

The difference between a README and an explainer isn't just words — it's *design*. Here's what the visual treatment does:

| README approach | Explainer approach |
|---|---|
| Starts with installation instructions | Starts with a compelling image and a one-liner about *why* |
| Lists features in bullet points | Tells a story: here's someone like you, here's their problem, here's how this solved it |
| Shows a code snippet | Shows an architecture diagram *and* a friendly illustration — meets both technical and non-technical readers |
| Assumes you already care | Earns your attention in the first 10 seconds |
| Text-only | Hero images, section illustrations, visual hierarchy that guides the eye |

The visual layer isn't decoration. It's the thing that makes someone stop scrolling and actually *read*.

### MetaHarness

## Quality you can trust

Every explainer passes through **5 automated quality gates** before it goes live. The pipeline doesn't just generate content — it evaluates its own output and only ships when every gate clears.

![The 5-gate quality system: gates A through E in sequence — knowledge base answers, comprehension and felt, consistency and dry-run, studio graded, visuals graded — each scoring at least 95.](assets/diagrams/five-gates.svg)

| Gate | What it checks | The bar |
|---|---|---|
| **A — Knowledge base** | Can the vector database answer real questions about the repo accurately? | Score >= 95 |
| **B — Comprehension** | Would a newcomer walk away thinking *"I get it and I want this"*? | Yes on all 3 checks |
| **C — Consistency** | Are all claims grounded in source? Do all links work? | Pass / fail |
| **D — Studio media** | Is the audio overview clear, confident, and complete? | Score >= 95 |
| **E — Visuals** | Does every section have both a friendly illustration *and* an accurate diagram? | Score >= 95 |

The headline quality score is always the **lowest gate**. An explainer is only as strong as its weakest section.

---

## The smart zip — so your AI gets it too

Every explainer also produces a **drop-in knowledge pack** for AI assistants. It has two halves:

![Two artifacts side by side: on the left a "For Humans" book — the explainer website; on the right a "For Your AI" folder — the drop-in smart zip — both being lifted out of one download.](assets/readme/dual-hero-output.png)

![The dual-hero output — an explainer website for humans and a drop-in smart zip for your AI, each labeled with what it contains.](assets/diagrams/dual-hero.svg)

- **`for-humans/`** — the written primer, audio overview, infographic, and deep-dive report
- **`for-ai/`** — a vector knowledge base of the repo's code and docs, plus a search tool and a Model Context Protocol server

Wire the `for-ai/` half into Claude Code or Cursor, and your AI answers from the **real source** instead of guessing. No more hallucinated APIs or invented function signatures.
