# Repo Explainer

### Turn any GitHub repo into a visual, approachable explainer page — for humans *and* for your AI.

*Complex repos deserve clear introductions. This builds them.*

## What is this?

You built something great and put it on GitHub. The problem: nobody understands it. Your README is written by someone who already gets it — for someone who already gets it. A newcomer lands on the repo, reads three paragraphs of jargon, and quietly closes the tab.

**Repo Explainer fixes that.** It's a repeatable pipeline that takes any GitHub repo and produces two things a newcomer actually needs:

1. **A beautiful explainer website** that teaches a curious human what the tool is, why they'd want it, and how to start.
2. **A drop-in "smart zip"** that makes their AI assistant instantly expert on that exact repo — no guessing, no hallucination.

> **How it works:** paste a GitHub URL → the pipeline reads the repo, builds a knowledge base, authors a visual explainer site, generates studio media (audio overview, infographic, report), runs 5 quality gates, and deploys the result to its own Vercel URL + GitHub repo.

---

## What does it produce?

Every repo gets **two hero artifacts**, both quality-gated:

![One download, two halves: an explainer website for humans on the left, and a drop-in smart zip for your AI on the right.](assets/img/dual-hero-output.png)

                   Two hero artifacts, one per repo

  HERO 1: THE EXPLAINER WEBSITE        HERO 2: THE DROP-IN SMART ZIP
  (for a curious human)                (one download — TWO halves)
  +---------------------------+        +--------------------------------------+
  | - Captivating hero + pitch|        |  for-humans/  (you)                  |
  | - Plain-language walkthru |        |   - Written primer                   |
  | - Before→after persona    |        |   - Studio media (audio, report,     |
  | - 5+ real use-cases       |        |     infographic)                     |
  | - Architecture diagrams   |        |  ------------------------------------|

                                       |   - Every passage from the repo      |
                                       +--------------------------------------+
```

</details>

**(a) The explainer website — so a human gets it.**
A self-contained site that opens with a captivating visual and a one-sentence pitch, then walks through the questions a newcomer actually asks: *What is this? What problem does it solve? How does it work? How do I start?* It anchors on a relatable persona with a real before→after story, then shows concrete use-cases. No setup, nothing to install — read it like a short illustrated story.

**(b) The drop-in smart zip — so your AI gets it.**
A single download with two halves. The `for-ai/` half is a vector knowledge base of the repo's own code and docs, plus a search tool and Model Context Protocol (MCP) server you can wire into Claude Code or Cursor. The `for-humans/` half includes the written primer and studio media — an audio overview, an infographic, and a deep-dive report. Unzip it, add a two-line config, and your AI answers from the **real source** instead of guessing.

## How it works — the Repo-Primer Pipeline

The whole point is that it's a **repeatable recipe**, not a one-off. Build one repo's explainer to a proven standard, then replay the identical pipeline on the next.

![The Repo-Primer Pipeline: a repo flows through build stages and five quality gates, producing an explainer site and a smart zip.](assets/img/pipeline.svg)

<details>

```
                       The Repo-Primer Pipeline

 +-------------+     +------------------+     +-------------------+     +----------------+
 |  Any GitHub | --> |      BUILD       | --> |  5 QUALITY GATES  | --> | Explainer site |
 |   repo      |     | 1 ingest tree    |     |  A KB answers     |     |  (for humans)  |
 |             |     | 2 vector KB      |     |  B comprehension  |     +----------------+
 |             |     | 3 explainer site |     |  C consistency    |     | Smart zip      |
 |             |     | 4 studio media   |     |  D studio graded  | --> |  (for your AI) |
 +-------------+     |                  |     |  E visuals graded |     +----------------+
                     +------------------+     |  each >=95        |
                                             +-------------------+
```

</details>

Per repo, the pipeline:

1. **Ingests the repo** — reads the code tree, skipping vendored or submodule code so the explainer teaches *this* tool only.
2. **Builds a vector knowledge base** — embeds the repo's code and docs locally (384-dimensional, structure-aware chunking at function/heading boundaries).
3. **Authors the explainer site** — image-first design, with dual-level visuals (a friendly illustration *and* an accurate architecture diagram per section), a relatable before→after persona, and prominent attribution to the original author.
4. **Generates studio media** — audio overview, infographic, and deep-dive report, all built from the repo's own content.
5. **Runs 5 quality gates** — and only declares "done" when every gate passes with evidence.
6. **Deploys** — to its own GitHub repo + Vercel site, then verifies the live URL returns HTTP 200.

### The 5 gates — "done = proven-good"

The hard-won rule: **"done" never means "the files exist."** The build evaluates its own output and only passes when every gate clears its bar.

  The headline score = the LOWEST gate. A primer is only as done as its weakest gate.
```

</details>

| Gate | What it checks | How it passes |
|---|---|---|
| **A — KB answers** | The vector knowledge base is queried with test questions; graded on retrieval relevance + answer correctness vs. source. | Score ≥ 95 on both tuned and held-out question sets. |
| **B — Comprehension** | A reviewer walks the live site as a newcomer — then answers: *Does this impress me? Invite me in? Make me want to use it?* | All three questions answered "yes." |
| **C — Consistency** | Claims grounded in source (no invented APIs), all sections present, ≥5 use-cases, links resolve, smart zip loads correctly. | Pass / fail. |
| **D — Studio graded** | Audio + report are reviewed for clarity, comfort, confidence, and completeness. | Score ≥ 95. |
| **E — Visuals graded** | Every image is checked — must include both a friendly on-ramp *and* an accurate architecture diagram. | Score ≥ 95. |

The standard bar is **≥ 98**; ≥ 95 is acceptable under time pressure.

## Build your own

### Option 1: Use the website (recommended)

Go to **[repo-explainer-six.vercel.app](https://repo-explainer-six.vercel.app)**, paste any public GitHub URL, optionally enter your email, and click **Build Explainer**. The pipeline does everything automatically — clone, analyze, build, quality-gate, deploy — and shows you real-time progress. When it's done, you get a live URL and a GitHub repo.

### Option 2: Run the pipeline yourself

1. **Configure the target** — add a per-repo config under [`config/repos/`](config/repos/).
2. **Build + grade the knowledge base** — the scripts in [`kb/`](kb/) build the vector DB and grade it (Gate A).
3. **Build + gate the site** — author the explainer (image-first, dual-level visuals, persona), run Gates B/C/E.
4. **Generate studio media** — audio overview, infographic, report. Grade them (Gate D).
5. **Deploy + verify** — ship to its own GitHub repo + Vercel site, verify HTTP 200.

### The 9 pipeline phases

| Phase | What it does | Time |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **P0** Setup | Checkout Repo-Explainer, install Node.js 20 + jq | ~30s |
| **P1** Clone | Shallow clone of the target repo, validate it exists | ~10s |
| **P2** Build KB | Run the knowledge base builder — embed code and docs into a vector DB | ~60s |
| **P3** Scaffold | Create the explainer site structure from a template | ~10s |
| **P4** Author | Generate the 7-section explainer content | ~90s |
| **P5** Images | Generate hero image and section illustrations (OpenAI) | ~60s |
| **P6** Quality gates | Run all 5 gates — KB answers, comprehension, consistency, studio, visuals | ~60s |
| **P7** Create repo | Create `stuinfla/{repo}-explainer` on GitHub, push all files, invite owner as collaborator | ~20s |
| **P8** Deploy | Deploy to Vercel, alias to `{repo}.repoexplainer.isovision.ai` | ~30s |
| **P9** Notify | Update gist with final URLs, send email notification | ~5s |

**Total: 5–10 minutes.** The user sees a real-time progress bar the entire time.

### Progress tracking

```
  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  GitHub Gist (status.json) — the single source   │
  │  of truth for build progress                     │

  │    "step": 3,                                    │
  │    "totalSteps": 9,                              │
  │    "stepName": "Scaffolding explainer site",     │
  │    "status": "running",                          │

  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The gist is **public** — no auth needed to read it. The client polls `/api/status?id=BUILD_ID&gist=GIST_ID` every 5 seconds. On network errors, it backs off exponentially (5s → 10s → 20s).

## When an explainer is built for your repo

Each explainer is **its own separate project** — a standalone GitHub repo and Vercel site:

- **Your own GitHub repo**: `stuinfla/yourproject-explainer` (you get invited as a collaborator with push access)
- **Your own Vercel URL**: `yourproject.repoexplainer.isovision.ai`
- **Your own files**: HTML, CSS, images, studio media, knowledge base — everything self-contained
- **No shared infrastructure**: nothing depends on any other explainer or on this pipeline repo

### What happens automatically
