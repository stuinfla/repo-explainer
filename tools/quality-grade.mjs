// quality-grade.mjs — STATION 7 tool: the dual-gate completion criterion.
//
// CONTRACT: tools/CONTRACT.md (the one BuildContext, the uniform invocation/return
// convention, PURE + FAIL-LOUD). Paired ADR-0005 Station 7 / "The QA System";
// paired DDD §8.5 Scorecard + §12 (the QA dual-gate as first-class domain).
//
// JOB (one mechanical job): render the ALREADY-ASSEMBLED site LOCALLY in a real
// browser (Playwright) at 390px (mobile) + 1440px (desktop), then grade it on two
// independent channels that DON'T fight each other:
//
//   (1) INV-18 PRESENCE — a deterministic DOM check (NOT the vision model). Playwright
//       asserts the ARCHITECTURE diagram AND the PROCESS/DATA-FLOW diagram elements
//       exist and are actually visible (rendered box > 0, not display:none) inside the
//       mandatory #how-it-works block. Present/absent is decided HERE, in the DOM — the
//       vision model is never asked "is it there?", only "does it read clearly?".
//
//   (2) CRAFT + SUBSTANCE — the GPT-4o vision grade against the VERBATIM Gate A/B
//       rubric (A1..A5 substance + B1..B5 anti-slop, each 0–100), graded from a few
//       FULL-RESOLUTION, viewport-height SECTION CROPS (hero · what-it-is · how-it-works
//       · get-started · the-pack), NOT one giant full-page screenshot downscaled into
//       mush. Each crop is capped at the device viewport so the model judges real,
//       sharp pixels (typography, alignment, imagery craft, diagram legibility).
//
// headlineScore = MIN across all 10 criteria. A device passes iff headlineScore >= 95
// AND INV-18 is clean (both diagrams DOM-present + DOM-visible + vision says each reads
// clearly). The build passes iff BOTH devices pass. Malformed / missing per-criterion
// scores → LOUD STOP, never a silent pass (ADR-0005 loud-fail postcondition; DDD §12.3).
//
// PURE: reads ONLY its declared slice of build.json (the `page` slot) + the
//   OPENAI_API_KEY from the environment. Writes ONLY the `quality` slot + its two
//   screenshots under <build-dir>/assets/. Never reads another tool's slot/files;
//   never writes another tool's slot/files.
// FAIL-LOUD: any failure → non-zero exit + a clear `error` string; never a silent
//   PASS, never a placeholder scorecard.
//
// Usage: node tools/quality-grade.mjs <build-dir>
//   env: OPENAI_API_KEY            (required — without it the page CANNOT be graded)
//        QUALITY_VISION_MODEL      (optional, default "gpt-4o")

const RUBRIC = `You are an EXACTING design-and-substance critic grading a software-explainer web page.
You are shown SEVERAL full-resolution, sharp SECTION CROPS of ONE page (in document
order) — together they represent the whole page. Score every criterion 0–100. Judge the
page AS A WHOLE from the crops; do not penalise a criterion merely because one crop
doesn't show everything.

You are CALIBRATED, not stingy. Excellence is real and reachable: when a criterion
genuinely clears the bar you award 90s — INCLUDING 95–100 — and you do NOT reflexively
cap at 90. Slop is equally real: when a criterion is generic or broken you score it low
and mean it. Your job is to place each criterion in the RIGHT band by the concrete
SIGNALS below, never to cluster everything in a cautious 70s–80s middle. A genuinely
publish-ready page reaches 95–100 on the criteria it nails; a templated one does not.

SCORING BANDS — anchor every Gate A and Gate B criterion to these SIGNALS, not to a vibe:
- 95–100  EXCEPTIONAL / publish-ready. A senior engineer sees it and says "I want to put
  this out." Signals: bespoke art direction you could NOT get from a template; a hero or
  diagram that makes you stop and look; copy that names the reader's real situation and the
  payoff in their own terms; diagrams that actually TEACH the mechanism; every section earns
  its place; nothing reads as generic. AWARD this whenever the criterion truly matches.
- 85–94   STRONG, minor nits. Clearly made by someone who cares — cohesive, intentional,
  mostly delightful — but one or two small, nameable flaws (a slightly cramped section, an
  image more decorative than explanatory, one wobble in the type hierarchy). Excellent-minus.
- 70–84   DECENT but generic or uneven. Competent and clean yet templated and forgettable,
  OR substance is present but never lands "why it matters to ME," OR the craft is fine but
  the story is just a list of facts. Nothing broken; nothing memorable.
- 50–69   MEDIOCRE. Flat, listy, default-feeling. Real gaps: weak hierarchy, decorative-only
  imagery, no narrative pull, the reader is assumed to already care.
- below 40  AI SLOP. Lorem-ipsum energy, default system fonts, stock-template layout, no
  story, no reader in mind — obviously "an LLM dumped this and nobody loved it."

Most real, professional pages land 85–94 on their strong criteria and lower on the weak
ones. Calibration means ACCURATE, not lenient: do not inflate slop to 95, and do not
deflate genuine excellence to 85 out of habit.

GATE A — "Do they actually get it?" (substance):
- A1 Visual effectiveness — compelling vs flat/forgettable.
- A2 Storytelling — tells a story vs lists facts.
- A3 Clueless→convinced — zero knowledge → why it matters → real examples → "oh, cool".
- A4 Usefulness-to-ME — explicitly answers "how is this useful to YOU" in the reader's OWN
  terms (names a concrete situation + the payoff). Cures engineer-blindness — the assumption
  the reader already cares.
- A5 Completeness of the arc — never-seen → ready to implement.
- A6 Implementation confidence — the reader knows EXACTLY what to do next: the Get-Started section
  shows the command, WHAT THEY'LL SEE when they run it, the step-by-step, what they get at the end, and
  what's next, with prerequisites stated. A5 is understanding; A6 is knowing how to ACT on it. A bare
  "just run this" with no sense of what happens or what comes next scores low.

GATE B — "Did someone who gives a shit make this?" (craft / anti-slop):
- B1 Typography & hierarchy — intentional, readable, ranked vs jangly.
- B2 Alignment & grid — aligned vs subtly-off / amateur.
- B3 Spacing & rhythm — breathes, consistent vs cramped / random.
- B4 Strength & polish — cohesive, deliberate vs generic AI-template slop.
- B5 Imagery craft — beautiful + explanatory + sequenced high→low vs pretty-but-useless;
  INCLUDING the structural SVG diagrams (crisp, legible, genuinely explanatory),
  judged for delight + craft. A "diagram" that is merely ASCII / box-drawing / pipe characters
  typeset as a picture (a screenshot of monospace text boxes) is SLOP — score B5 below 40 and set
  makesMeSmile=false; real diagrams are DRAWN (shapes, cards, arrows), not typeset text.

OPERATOR QUALITATIVE GATE — five YES/NO questions (the owner's words). As a harsh critic, answer each
true/false from the crops; ALL five must be true for the page to be done, independent of the numeric
axes (a page can clear the numbers and still fail one of these):
 (1) believeIUnderstand — Would this make me believe I understand this?
 (2) approachable — Would this make it approachable?
 (3) explainsToNovice — Would this explain it for somebody who doesn't understand it?
 (4) architectureConfidence — Would it give me confidence I understand the architecture?
 (5) makesMeSmile — Does it make me smile — "oh, that's cool"?

INV-18 — CLARITY ONLY. The page is already DOM-verified to CONTAIN both an ARCHITECTURE
diagram (modules / components / dependencies) and a PROCESS / DATA-FLOW diagram (the
runtime flow); they live in the "How it works / How is it built?" crop. You do NOT
decide whether they exist. Your ONLY job for INV-18 is to say whether EACH diagram, as
rendered in the crops you can see, READS CLEARLY — legible labels, sensible structure,
not a blurry or scrambled mess. If a diagram is legible and explanatory, readsClearly
is true; if it's illegible/garbled in the crop, readsClearly is false.

For EACH criterion give a written rationale that cites what you actually SEE in the crops
AND names the band you placed it in (e.g. "85–94: strong, but …") so the score is auditable.`;

// Strict JSON shape the grader MUST return (response_format: json_object).
// NOTE: presence/visibility of the two diagrams is decided by the DOM check, NOT here —
// the model only reports whether each one READS CLEARLY in the crops.
const RESPONSE_SPEC = `Return ONLY a JSON object, no prose, with EXACTLY this shape:
{
  "gateA": { "A1": <int 0-100>, "A2": <int>, "A3": <int>, "A4": <int>, "A5": <int>, "A6": <int> },
  "gateB": { "B1": <int 0-100>, "B2": <int>, "B3": <int>, "B4": <int>, "B5": <int> },

    "flowNote":                  "<what you SAW of the flow/process diagram>"
  }
}
